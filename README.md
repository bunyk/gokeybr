# Gokeybr
Minimalistic touch-typing training program, that tries to improve on [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) by generating training lessons not only from words, but with symbols from code, or any other type of text you would want to train on. It probably best fit for users that are already learned positions of keys, know how to touch type, and now want to improve their typing speed.

You could, for example, train to type ten `if err != nil { return err }` per minute and become fastest Go coder.

![Screenshot of a Gokeybr session](screenshot.png)

On the screenshot you see `gokeybr` running in `random` mode, where it generates training session based on your typing stats. In this case it mixes code with "words", based on frequency and typing speed of character sequences in texts that were used for other training sessions.

This program intentionally ignores stats on errors, instead tracking time needed to successfully type any text. But you are required to correct errors before making futher progress in exercise. So when you need to type `the`, and you type `tje[backspace][backspace]he`, result will be the same, you will probably need more time to type all that wrong, hit backspaces and type it correctly, so that will influence stats and the increase measure of necessity to practice typing `the`.

The more often some sequence of keys appear in text the bigger will be the need to type it faster. But the closer your typing speed for that sequence approaches "speed of light" of 150 wpm, the harder it will be for you to improve that, so training sessions are generated by taking that two aspects into account. `random` and `weakest` mode generate sessions with most frequent but slow to type character sequences. After some sequence will reach speed 150 wpm, it is ulikely to appear in training texts.

## Installation
```bash
go get github.com/bunyk/gokeybr
```

## Usage
Run it, type text on the screen, hit `Esc` when you will want to interrupt training sessions and that's it.

`gokeybr --help` will give you the latest & most true information with which parameters gokeybr could be started. Here is short overview of how you could use it:

- `gokeybr text some_text.txt` - practice typing text. `-o` allows you to change line from which to start, default 0 or line you last finished at.
- `gokeybr words` - practice typing words from dictionary. Dictionary is text file with one word per line, you could choose your own.
- `fortune | gokeybr text -` - type random quote, just like on typeracer, but unfortunately without competition.
- `gokeybr random` - random text similar to keybr.com, based on your stats. If you trained on some code - you will get curly brackets, etc.
- `gokeybr weakest` - exercise what needs to be exercised the most to make your better typist.
- `gokeybr stats` - show short report of what gokeybr knows about you.


## How to improve your typing speed?
This software will try you to apply so called "deliberate practice" to touch typing. Best described in article
[The Making of an Expert](https://hbr.org/2007/07/the-making-of-an-expert), by researcher on that topic Karl Ericsson.

People get better with practice, but not any kind of practice. Just typing daily will not improve your typing speed, as daily walking would not improve your running speed. This is because you do things you already know how to do. The golf champion Sam Snead once put it: "It is only human nature to want to practice what you can already do well, since it's a hell of a lot less work and a hell of a lot more fun."
 
Deliberate practice different, it is practice that focuses on tasks beyond your current level of competence and comfort. You need to do something that you can't do well.

`gokeybr` monitors your weakest key sequences, and allows you to train them when started with `gokeybr weakest`. 

## Alternatives

- [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/) - web app where you race against others by typing quotes from books or movies.
- [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) - web app that gives you random "words" to type, gathers some stats and somehow tunes exercises to better improve your progress.
- [typelit.io](https://www.typelit.io/) - web app that allows you to practice by typing good classic novels. So you could combine fun of reading with practice of typing. Also you will practice typing sentences of best authors, that should improve your language too. (This kind of practice could be done with `gokeybr` too, just save your favourite novel in some text file, and run `gokeybr text novel.txt`. `gokeybr` will safe last line you typed on, so in each session you will continue from where you left off last time.)
` [gotypist](https://github.com/pb-/gotypist) - app for terminal where you type texts line by line, each line three times - slow (minimizing errors), fast (ignoring errors, maximizing speed), and 


## Code
A fork of [gotypist](https://github.com/pb-/gotypist), rewritten to use [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/) instead of [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go). Also added support for multiline typing sessions and statistically generated exercises. Removed modes, so in each session you could strive for any result you wish.

Acrhitecture is changed from Elm-like to more classical. Code is split in following packages:

- `cmd/` - is entry point of the program, handles parsing of arguments and starts app
- `app/` - contains code of event loop and overall logic of typing session
- `phrase/` - loading and generation of training texts
- `view/` - anyting related to displaying information on the screen
- `stats/` - keeping track of your progress & helping to generate most useful training session
- `fs/` - utilities to work with filesystem storage
